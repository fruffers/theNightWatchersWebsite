                    <h2>About TNW</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Night Watchers is a fantasy webcomic. TNW takes place in Elbion, a fantasy land of monsters, magic, and those who fear both of those things.
                        TNW follows the story of the Woth Wynton, the 'Dragon Slayer'. A large and tremendously strong man who is as arrogant as he tries to be polite.
                        Woth might appear unruly and even frightening, but his mind is soft; for he desperately wants to become just like his idol the honourable fictional knight 'Thornheart' and earn the
                        praise of the kingdom's people. Woth was once the most respected warrior throughout Elbion, earning his name after striking down the fiendish dragon Smog. In these flowering days Woth could kill the most terrifying monsters with ease.
                        But he unexpectedly lost his power and with it the people's respect;
                        now they laugh and insult him as he walks by.
                        He looks to regain his position, but has only dirtied his reputation further with his mercenary jobs for the rich, yet fighting is all he knows and loves. Now he begins to wonder whether the people he is sent to kill really are as bad
                        as his contractors' say. And as does his mind ponder the same when it conjures illusions and nightmares that haunt him.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Woth finds Maude, a cambion, about to be caught and killed. And she has a magical chalice, one that grants any wish when drank from at the disappearing lake.
                        It's just what Woth needs to finally regain his fame. But first he needs to take the chalice from her, then he can embark on the perilous journey to find the lake and become the flawless
                        hero he so dreams to be. But Woth isn't the only
                        one who wants the chalice, not when those such as Woth's very own King also desire it.

                    <p>The comic may include: profanity, violence, death, alcohol, partial nudity, manipulation, and mature themes.</p>

                    <h2>What's up with the comic's name?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Honestly I had no idea what to call the comic. This name was not ideal but it stuck after I used it as a substitute for a later name. The Night Watchers refers to the three main characters
                        taking turns to 'night watch' for danger when they camp to go to sleep for the night. 'Watchers' infers that they are a team, and is where the heart of the story lies; in the theme of friendship.

                    <h2>About the Author</h2>
                    <p>
                        TNW is a project by me, Fruffers. I draw art as a hobby, I'm still learning the way of the pen/cil/s but I love (to read) comics. This comic was made for entertainment purposes,
                        yours and mine. I use Paint Tool Sai, Clip Studio, and Photoshop to make the comic.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In 2015 the project was originally going to be a joint one with two of my other friends Terry and Katie. We each designed a character and
                        decided we'd roleplay the parts for our characters and draw pages in turn. But we became busy and split ways on the comic.
                        I carried the idea on and reworked it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The comic uses many stereotypes and pokes fun at certain fantasy tropes. There are also many references to other popular works and many characters
                        have been inspired by other well known ones. And shamefully even my own gaming life has inspired some of the characters; such as
                        Woth who was inspired by my Skyrim character who had a chicken mod.

                    <h2>||| FAQ |||</h2>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Why do some characters have longer hair?</h5> The characters with longer hair usually have more money. In Werth
                        (the world TNW takes place in) it is generally the rich who can afford the products to care for longer hair and have more time to bath. Serfs (famers etc.) do a lot of manual labour so they will often cut their hair short
                        for the practicality of it not getting in their way. Hats are also very popular to keep hair from needing to be cleaned as often.
                        Thus long hair is a symbol of high status.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <h5>What's the significance of the colours that the characters wear?</h5>Again, this correlates with the amount of money the characters
                        have and the dyes they can afford. Red, purple, and yellow dyes are expensive whereas green and blue dyes are the cheapest. Although
                        some characters may also wear colours that allow one to identify them or symbolise something about them; such as Maude who wears darker sleeves to connote her moral ambiguity
                        and red pouches to connote her anger. Woth's strong association with the colour purple resembles his pride. And finally, the characters who
                        wear red will mostly all desire power in some form.
                    </p>

                    <p><h5>Why do Woth's eyebrows show over his helmet?</h5>Shh! Don't question that. They help show his expressions.</p>

                    <p><h5>What are the different magic types?</h5>Grey (studied), Blue (monster), Black (demons/dead), White (only used by Gods)</p>

                    <p>
                        <h5>What is the whole 'red blood' and 'blue blood' thing about?</h5>Monsters have blue blood because of the magic which is within it. This magic makes them mutated (in the way that they are large and may have abilities)
                        and powerful. But the fact that they have this magic within them makes them unable to eat other Monsters because the different magic will hurt them by reacting violently with their own, which is why they eat True. 'True' (humans and animals) on the other hand have no magic in their blood, therefore it is red. But they can learn
                        grey magic which will be conjured outside their body.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <h5>Huh? Insects don't have blood so what are they classed as?</h5>
                        Insects are 'True' because they have no magic. If they were a monster they would be much bigger because of their magic mutations and therefore need to have blood. But if a small insect was a monster then the 
                        same rule would apply; their fluid/hemolymph would be blue. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <h5>What are 'subhumans'?</h5>
                        Subhumans are humanoids which are True but are not pure human (Homo sapien). They are a different species and may be half lizard, or cat etc. Subhumans have just evolved differently. They are regarded to be inferior to pure humans.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <h5>How does the currency work?</h5>
                        1 gold = 100 silver
                        <br />
                        1 silver = 100 copper
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The price of a cottage would be around 400 gold. An apple might cost 30 copper. A shirt would be 20 silver. A sword would cost 2 gold.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <h5>What are the 4 realms?</h5>Firstly a realm is a different plane of being, in other words its a different version of the universe.
                        The Upper-Realm, Middle-Realm, Under-Realm, and Purgatory. The Upper-Realm is a paradise where all who have done
                        no significant wrong in their life go. The Middle-Realm is where the living are (and apparitions). The Lower-Realm is
                        where those who have done significant wrong in their life go and become demons. Purgatory is where the dead are judged for their sins in life, they are either reborn into the middle realm
                        in a new body or sent to the upper or lower realm.
                        However, it is not known if the Upper-Realm and Purgatory really exists,
                        but most True believe that they do. And some mages have even been known to create their own small realms.
