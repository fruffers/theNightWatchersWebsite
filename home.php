                    <h3>What is the comic about?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We follow the adventures of the largely conceited and violent but genteel mercenary Woth.
                        And his journey to become a true hero like his fictional idol Thornheart.
                        Woth rose to fame and was given the title ‘Dragon Slayer’ after defeating the dragon Smog.
                        Despite this nobody liked him… So how could he be a hero? He must not have been strong enough.
                        A chance for power he needs arises in the form of the BURNNING CHALICE.
                        Woth sets out to get his wish with the Chalice but he must find the Disappearing Lake to use it.
                        However he's not the only one who wants the Chalice,
                        and despite his determination he can't do this alone.
